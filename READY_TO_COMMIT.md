## 📞 If Something Goes Wrong

### Build Fails on Vercel
- Check build logs in Vercel dashboard
- Most likely: dependency issue (shouldn't happen)
- Solution: No new deps added, should succeed

### Console Errors in Production
- Check which errors (CSP? MIME type? Other?)
- Refer to CSP_MIME_TYPE_FIX.md
- Most likely: New domains need to be added to CSP

### Features Not Working
- Check if it's local or production issue
- Test locally first (npm run dev)
- If local works but prod doesn't, check env vars

### Can't Test on Real Device
- Use Chrome DevTools device mode
- Simulates mobile well enough
- Real device testing can wait
