**Technical Implementation:**
- `EnhancedQueryUnderstanding` class with comprehensive NLP pipeline
- Spelling correction dictionary with 50+ common misspellings
- Intent scoring system with confidence levels
- Entity extraction for places, cuisines, dietary needs, etc.
- Query enhancement patterns for incomplete queries

**Examples:**
- "restorant recomendations in kadikoy" ‚Üí "restaurant recommendations in kadikoy"
- "vegetarian places" ‚Üí Detected intent: restaurant_search, entities: dietary_restrictions=['vegetarian']

### 3. Knowledge Scope ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Previously ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê)

### 4. Follow-up Questions ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Previously ‚≠ê‚≠ê)

**Implemented Features:**
- **Conversational Flow**: Maintains context between related questions
- **Follow-up Detection**: Recognizes when user is asking for more information
- **Contextual Responses**: Provides relevant follow-up based on previous recommendations
- **Progressive Assistance**: Builds on previous answers to provide deeper insights

**Technical Implementation:**
- `ContextAwareResponseGenerator` with follow-up detection
- Pattern recognition for follow-up questions ("more", "what about", "also")
- Context-aware response templates
- Progressive recommendation system

**Examples:**
- User: "restaurants in Kadikoy" ‚Üí Bot: [restaurant list]
- User: "what about vegetarian options?" ‚Üí Bot: References previous query and provides targeted vegetarian recommendations
- User: "how much should I tip?" ‚Üí Bot: Provides tipping advice specific to restaurants mentioned earlier
