## 🎯 Intent Priority Levels

### High Priority (Core Features)
```python
HIGH_PRIORITY = [
    "restaurant",      # Most common query
    "attraction",      # Core tourism
    "gps_navigation",  # Critical for navigation
    "transportation",  # Essential service
    "emergency",       # Safety-critical
]
```

### Medium Priority (Common Features)
```python
MEDIUM_PRIORITY = [
    "weather",
    "events",
    "museum",
    "route_planning",
    "recommendation",
    "booking",
    "accommodation",
]
```

### Lower Priority (Specialized Features)
```python
LOWER_PRIORITY = [
    "hidden_gems",
    "local_tips",
    "luxury",
    "romantic",
    "family_activities",
    "nightlife",
    "shopping",
]
```

---

## 💻 Implementation Requirements

### For Each Intent, We Need:

#### 1. Intent Handler Function
```python
def handle_restaurant(query, context):
    """Handle restaurant-related queries"""
    # Extract: location, cuisine, dietary, price
    # Query database
    # Format response
    # Return results
```

#### 2. Entity Extraction
```python
# From query: "Beyoğlu'nda vejetaryen restoran"
entities = {
    'location': 'Beyoğlu',
    'dietary': 'vegetarian',
    'intent': 'restaurant'
}
```

#### 3. Database Query
```python
# Query restaurant database with filters
results = db.query_restaurants(
    district='Beyoğlu',
    dietary_restrictions=['vegetarian']
)
```

#### 4. Response Formatter
```python
# Format results for user
response = format_restaurant_response(
    results, 
    include_map=True,
    include_directions=True
)
```
