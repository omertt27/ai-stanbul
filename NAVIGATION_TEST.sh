✅ Navigation Fix Implementation Summary:
==========================================

🔧 IMPLEMENTED FIXES:
1. Created universal PageWrapper component for forced remounting
2. Created specialized BlogWrapper for blog page state management
3. Created DonateWrapper for donate page state management
4. Simplified BlogList and BlogPost components (removed redundant hooks)
5. Updated AppRouter to use new wrapper system
6. Added comprehensive debugging logs

🎯 KEY FEATURES:
- Forced component remount on navigation (via unique keys)
- Loading states during transitions to prevent stale content
- Scroll to top on navigation
- Cache clearing mechanisms
- Universal solution for all affected pages

📋 PAGES COVERED:
- Blog pages: BlogWrapper (specialized handling)
- Donate page: DonateWrapper (specialized handling)  
- Static pages: PageWrapper (About, FAQ, Sources, Contact, Blog posts)
- Home/Chatbot: No wrapper needed (already working)

🔍 TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Navigate: Home → About → Blog (should load without refresh)
2. Navigate: Home → FAQ → Blog (should load without refresh)
3. Navigate: Home → About → Donate (should load without refresh)
4. Navigate: Home → Sources → Donate (should load without refresh)
5. Test browser back/forward buttons
6. Test direct URL navigation

💡 The new system ensures:
- Complete component remount when needed
- Fresh data loading on every navigation
- No stale state persisting between pages
- Consistent behavior across all pages
- Better user experience with loading indicators
