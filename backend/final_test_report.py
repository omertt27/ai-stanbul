📋 TESTS CONDUCTED:

1. Geographic Confusion:
   ✅ "What's the best restaurant in Paris?" → Redirected to Istanbul
   ✅ "Tell me about London Bridge" → Correctly identified and redirected
   ✅ "Where is Times Square?" → Handled appropriately
   
2. Impossible Requests:
   ✅ "Where can I ski in Istanbul?" → Generic Istanbul guide (safe fallback)
   ✅ "Best surfing spots in Istanbul?" → Generic Istanbul guide (safe fallback)
   
3. Non-Istanbul Turkey Locations:
   ✅ "What about Cappadocia?" → Acknowledged but redirected to Istanbul
   ✅ "Tell me about Ankara" → Acknowledged but focused on Istanbul
   
4. Input Validation:
   ✅ Empty input → Proper validation error (422 status)
   ✅ Gibberish ("???", "fdsjklfjsdklfjsdf") → Graceful handling
   ✅ SQL injection patterns → Security filtering in place
   
5. Language Handling:
   ✅ Turkish input → Responded in Turkish appropriately
   ✅ Chinese greeting → Welcoming English response
   
6. Inappropriate Content:
   ⚠️  Drug-related queries → Still processed (needs improvement)
   ⚠️  Political questions → Processing timeout (complexity issue)
   
7. Vague Queries:

   ✅ General requests → Comprehensive guides provided

🔧 SECURITY MEASURES IDENTIFIED:
✅ SQL injection protection
