            'cultural_knowledge': 'deep_istanbul_local'
        }
        
    def handle_small_talk(self, query: str) -> str:
        """Handle weather, traffic, daily life conversations"""
        patterns = {
            'weather': self._weather_small_talk,
            'traffic': self._traffic_update,
