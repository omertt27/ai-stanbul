## 🏗️ Architecture Design

### Current Flow (Rule-Based Only)
```
User Query → main_system.py → Rule Matching → Response
```

### New Flow (Hybrid: Neural + Rule-Based)
```
User Query 
    ↓
main_system.py
    ↓
neural_query_classifier.py
    ↓
Confidence Check
    ↓
├─ High (≥70%): Use neural prediction
└─ Low (<70%): Fallback to rules
    ↓
Response + Log prediction
```

## 💻 Implementation Plan

### File 1: `neural_query_classifier.py` (NEW)
**Purpose:** Neural query classification with caching and logging

**Features:**
- Load model once at startup (singleton pattern)
- Process queries in <15ms
- Return intent + confidence score
- Log all predictions to file
- Handle errors gracefully

**Key Methods:**
```python
class NeuralQueryClassifier:
    def __init__(self, model_path)
    def predict(query: str) -> (intent: str, confidence: float)
    def batch_predict(queries: List[str])
    def log_prediction(query, intent, confidence)
    def reload_model()  # For hot-swapping
```

### File 2: `main_system.py` (UPDATE)
**Changes:**
- Import `NeuralQueryClassifier`
- Initialize at startup
- Use neural prediction first
- Fallback to rules if confidence < 70%
- Log decision path

**Hybrid Logic:**
```python
# Try neural first
intent, confidence = neural_classifier.predict(query)

if confidence >= 0.70:
    # Use neural prediction
    response = handle_neural_intent(intent, query)
else:
    # Fallback to rules
    response = rule_based_handler(query)
    
# Log for retraining
log_query(query, intent, confidence, response)
```

### File 3: `integration_test.py` (NEW)
**Purpose:** Test suite for neural integration

**Tests:**
- 100 diverse queries across all 25 intents
- Latency benchmarks
- Accuracy verification
- Fallback behavior
- Edge cases

## 📊 Expected Performance

### Latency Breakdown
```
Total Target: <50ms

Neural Classification:  11ms  (measured)
Rule-based Fallback:    ~5ms  (estimate)
Response Generation:    ~10ms (estimate)

------------------------
Total:                  ~31ms ✅ Under budget!
```

### Accuracy Expectations

**Week 1 (Current Model):**

- Overall accuracy: ~85%

**Week 2 (With 100 real queries):**
- Neural accuracy: 83-85%
- Fallback rate: ~10%
- Overall accuracy: ~88%

**Month 1 (With 500+ real queries):**
- Neural accuracy: 88-90%
- Fallback rate: ~5%
- Overall accuracy: ~92%

## 🎓 Hybrid Decision Logic

### When to Use Neural Prediction
✅ Confidence ≥ 70%
✅ Intent in training classes
✅ Model loaded successfully
✅ Query in Turkish

### When to Fallback to Rules
⚠️ Confidence < 70%
⚠️ Unknown intent (not in 25 classes)
⚠️ Model loading error
⚠️ Query in other language
⚠️ Emergency queries (always use rules)

### Special Cases
🚨 **Emergency:** Always use rules (faster, safer)
📍 **GPS Navigation:** Prefer neural (better context understanding)
🍽️ **Restaurant:** Prefer neural (handles variations well)
📅 **Events:** Hybrid (neural for intent, rules for date extraction)
