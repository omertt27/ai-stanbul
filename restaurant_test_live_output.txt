✅ Response: 🏛️ **Turkish Culture & Etiquette in Istanbul**

Istanbul is a beautiful blend of Eastern and Western cultures! Here are some key cultural insights:

**Social Customs**:
• Turkish people are incredibly hospitable - "Misafir Allah'ın konuğudur" (Guests are God's guests!)
• It's common to be offered çay (tea) - accepting is polite and shows respect
• Greeting with a handshake is common; close friends kiss on both cheeks

**Mosque Etiquette**:
• Remove shoes before entering (shelves provided)
• Dress modestly: cover shoulders and knees
• Ladies should cover their hair (free headscarves at entrance)
• Be quiet and respectful during prayer times

**Dining Etiquette**:
• Say "Afiyet olsun!" (Enjoy your meal!) before eating
• It's polite to try everything offered
• Sharing food is a sign of friendship

**Shopping Culture**:
• Bargaining is expected at bazaars (not rude, it's tradition!)
• Start at 50-60% of asking price
• It's a social interaction, smile and have fun!

**Daily Life**:
• Family is very important in Turkish culture
• Respect for elders is deeply ingrained
• Public displays of affection are generally modest
