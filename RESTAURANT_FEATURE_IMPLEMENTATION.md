# Restaurant Recommendation Feature Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Backend API Integration
- Added `fetchRestaurantRecommendations` function to `/frontend/src/api/api.js`
- The function calls the existing backend endpoint `/restaurants/search?limit=4`
- Uses proper error handling and logging for debugging

### 2. Frontend Logic Enhancement
- Added `isRestaurantAdviceRequest` function to detect when users ask for restaurant advice
- Enhanced keyword detection to include phrases like:
  - "restaurant advice"
  - "give me restaurant"
  - "recommend restaurants"
  - "food recommendation"
  - And many more variations

### 3. Restaurant Response Formatting
- Added `formatRestaurantRecommendations` function to format API responses
- Creates a well-structured response with:
  - Restaurant name and rating
  - Address/location 
  - Description from Google Places
  - Professional formatting with emojis and markdown

### 4. Chatbot Integration
- Modified `handleSend` function in `Chatbot.jsx`
- Added restaurant request detection before regular AI processing
- When restaurant advice is detected:
  - Calls the restaurant API
  - Formats the response appropriately
  - Returns exactly 4 restaurant recommendations
  - Falls back to regular AI chat if API fails

### 5. Updated UI Elements
- Changed the sample question button from "Find authentic Turkish restaurants" 
- To "Give me restaurant advice - recommend 4 good restaurants"
- This triggers the new restaurant recommendation flow

## How It Works

1. **User Input Detection**: When a user types or clicks a request containing restaurant-related keywords
2. **API Call**: The system calls `http://localhost:8001/restaurants/search?limit=4`
3. **Data Processing**: The response is formatted into a user-friendly message
4. **Display**: Shows exactly 4 restaurant recommendations with details
5. **Fallback**: If restaurant API fails, falls back to regular AI conversation

## Key Features
