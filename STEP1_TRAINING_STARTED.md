**Date:** October 21, 2025 23:29:20  
**Status:** üü¢ RUNNING  
**Expected Duration:** ~27 minutes

## What We Just Did

### 1. Created Extended Training Script
**File:** `phase2_extended_training_v2.py`

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Loads 676 comprehensive training samples
- ‚úÖ Uses DistilBERT multilingual model
- ‚úÖ Trains on Apple MPS GPU
- ‚úÖ 150 epochs (adding to previous 100 = 250 total)
- ‚úÖ Lower learning rate (2e-5) for fine-tuning
- ‚úÖ Automatic benchmarking on 26 test queries
- ‚úÖ Detailed error analysis
- ‚úÖ Per-intent accuracy tracking

### 2. Fixed Data Format Issues
- Corrected intent class list to match training data
- Updated test queries to use correct intent labels
- Fixed data parsing (list format vs dict format)

### 3. Installed Missing Dependencies
```bash
pip3 install 'accelerate>=0.26.0'
```

### 4. Started Training Successfully
```
Started:    23:29:20
Progress:   ~4 iterations/second
Total:      6,450 iterations
ETA:        ~23:56:00
```

## Expected Results

### Baseline (Before This Training)
From 100-epoch training:
- Accuracy: **75.8%** (51/67 correct)
- Latency: **14.9ms** average
- P95 Latency: **19.9ms**

### Target (After 150 More Epochs)
Conservative: **80-85% accuracy**
- Good enough for production
- Can improve with real data
- Ready to integrate

Optimistic: **85-90% accuracy**
- Exceeds target
- Excellent for production
- Deploy immediately

### Why This Should Work
1. **More epochs:** 150 ‚Üí 250 total allows deeper learning
2. **Good baseline:** Not starting from random (75.8%)
3. **Balanced data:** All intents well-represented
4. **Quality samples:** Real Turkish tourism queries
5. **Proven approach:** Same method that got us to 75.8%

## What Happens When Training Completes

### Automatic (Script Does This)
1. ‚úÖ Saves final model weights
2. ‚úÖ Runs 26 test queries
3. ‚úÖ Calculates accuracy per intent
4. ‚úÖ Measures latency (avg, P95, P99)
5. ‚úÖ Identifies confused intent pairs
6. ‚úÖ Generates results JSON
7. ‚úÖ Prints summary report

### Manual (Your Decision)
```
IF accuracy ‚â• 85%:
    ‚úÖ Move to Phase 2 Day 2: Integration
    ‚úÖ Update main_system.py
    ‚úÖ Test with 1000 queries
    ‚úÖ Prepare for A/B testing
    
ELSE IF accuracy ‚â• 80%:
    ‚ö†Ô∏è  Decision: Integrate now OR add more data?
    üí° Recommendation: Integrate, improve with real data
    
ELSE (accuracy < 80%):
    üîÑ Add 100-200 targeted samples
    üîÑ Focus on confused intents
    üîÑ Train 50 more epochs
```

### Option 3: Do Something Else
Come back in ~27 minutes and run:
```bash
python3 check_training_status.py
```

### Option 4: Review Documentation
While waiting, read:

## üéâ Bottom Line

**You've successfully started Step 1: Extended Training!**

The model is now training on 676 Turkish tourism queries for 150 epochs to push accuracy from 75.8% to 85-90%. The Apple MPS GPU is working hard, processing ~4 iterations per second.

In ~27 minutes, we'll know if we've hit the target and can move to integration, or if we need to add more targeted training data.

Either way, we're making excellent progress! üöÄ
