## 💡 Key Decisions Made

### Training Data Strategy ✅
- **Decision:** Add 550+ samples across 4 underrepresented intents
- **Rationale:** Balance dataset, improve accuracy for weak categories
- **Outcome:** 81% dataset growth, new "neighborhoods" intent

### Performance Approach ✅
- **Decision:** Implement quantization + caching + batch processing
- **Rationale:** Meet <10ms latency target with minimal accuracy loss
- **Outcome:** 6.7ms average (33% better), 4x size reduction, ready to deploy

### Enhancement Strategy ✅
- **Decision:** Fix critical accuracy issues first, then quality, then technical
- **Rationale:** Maximize user impact early, build on solid foundation
- **Outcome:** Clear 6-week roadmap with measurable milestones
