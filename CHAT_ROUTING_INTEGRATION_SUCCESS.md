## 🎯 Integration Points

### 1. Service Initialization
```python
# In main_system.py _init_integrations()
if ROUTING_SERVICE_AVAILABLE:
    self.routing_service = get_routing_service()
    if self.routing_service and self.routing_service.is_initialized:
        logger.info("🗺️ Industry-level routing service initialized")
```

### 2. Query Processing
```python
# In main_system.py process_message()
if self.routing_service and self.routing_service.is_initialized:
    routing_response = self.routing_service.process_routing_query(user_input)
    if routing_response:
        logger.info("🗺️ Route planned successfully")
        return routing_response
```

### 3. Fallback System
```python
# Graceful degradation
Priority 1: Routing Service (graph-based pathfinding)
Priority 2: Advanced Transport System (İBB API)
Priority 3: General Transport Info (static information)
```
