## 🚀 Optional Advanced Enhancements (Still CPU-only, No GPT)

### Option 1: Enhanced Intent Classification with Fasttext
**Technology**: Facebook's fastText
**Cost**: Free (CPU-only)
**Benefits**: 
- Better multi-language support (Turkish + English)
- Faster than spaCy for classification
- Pre-trained models available
- ~95% accuracy for intent classification

```python
# Implementation:
import fasttext

# Train on Istanbul-specific queries
model = fasttext.train_supervised(
    'transportation_intents.txt',
    lr=0.5,
    epoch=25,
    wordNgrams=2
)

# Use for intent classification
intent, confidence = model.predict(user_query)
```

**Estimated Setup Time**: 2-3 hours
**Training Data Needed**: 500-1000 labeled queries
**Memory**: ~50MB model size

---

### Option 2: Semantic Search with Sentence Transformers (CPU-optimized)
**Technology**: sentence-transformers (distilled models)
**Cost**: Free (CPU-only, quantized models)
**Benefits**:
- Better semantic understanding
- Find similar routes/queries
- Works with Turkish and English
- CPU-optimized mini models

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

# Use distilled, CPU-friendly model
model = SentenceTransformer('paraphrase-MiniLM-L3-v2')  # Only 17MB!

# Generate embeddings for semantic search
query_embedding = model.encode(user_query)
route_embeddings = model.encode(all_routes)

# Find most similar routes
similarities = cosine_similarity(query_embedding, route_embeddings)
```

**Estimated Setup Time**: 1-2 hours
**Model Size**: 17-60MB (distilled versions)
**Performance**: 50-150ms per query on CPU

---

### Option 3: Turkish Language Model (spaCy)
**Technology**: spaCy Turkish pipeline
**Cost**: Free (CPU-only)
**Benefits**:
- Better Turkish query understanding
- Improved entity extraction for Turkish locations
- Native Turkish sentiment analysis

```bash
# Install Turkish model
python -m spacy download tr_core_news_md
```

```python
import spacy

# Load Turkish model
nlp_tr = spacy.load('tr_core_news_md')

# Process Turkish queries
doc = nlp_tr("Taksim'den Sultanahmet'e nasıl giderim?")
entities = [(ent.text, ent.label_) for ent in doc.ents]
```

**Estimated Setup Time**: 30 minutes
**Model Size**: ~50MB
**Accuracy Improvement**: +15-20% for Turkish queries

---

### Option 4: Query Autocomplete & Suggestion System
**Technology**: Trie data structure + TF-IDF
**Cost**: Free (in-memory processing)
**Benefits**:
- Suggest completions as user types
- Correct common misspellings
- Learn from popular queries

```python
class QuerySuggester:
    def __init__(self):
        self.trie = TrieNode()
        self.popular_queries = {}
    
    def suggest(self, partial_query: str) -> List[str]:
        """Suggest completions for partial query"""
        suggestions = self.trie.search_prefix(partial_query)
        return sorted(suggestions, 
                     key=lambda x: self.popular_queries.get(x, 0),
                     reverse=True)[:5]
```

**Estimated Setup Time**: 3-4 hours
**Memory**: ~10MB for 10k queries
**Performance**: <10ms per suggestion

---

### Option 5: Pattern-Based Query Normalization
**Technology**: Regex + fuzzy matching
**Cost**: Free (CPU-only)
**Benefits**:
- Handle typos and variations
- Normalize location names
- Extract route patterns reliably

```python
import re
from fuzzywuzzy import fuzz

class QueryNormalizer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.location_aliases = {
            'taksim': ['taksin', 'taxim', 'taqsim'],
            'sultanahmet': ['sultanahme', 'sultanahment', 'sultanahmed'],
            # ... more aliases
        }
    
    def normalize(self, query: str) -> str:
        """Normalize query with fuzzy matching"""
        normalized = query.lower().strip()
        
        # Handle common misspellings
        for canonical, aliases in self.location_aliases.items():
            for alias in aliases:
                if fuzz.ratio(normalized, alias) > 85:
                    normalized = normalized.replace(alias, canonical)
        
        return normalized
```

**Estimated Setup Time**: 2-3 hours
**Memory**: Negligible
**Accuracy Improvement**: +10-15% for misspelled queries
