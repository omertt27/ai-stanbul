### Why you don't need TripAdvisor immediately:

1. **Google Places is comprehensive**:
   - Already includes user reviews
   - Has ratings and photos
   - Provides business hours and contact info
   - Covers most restaurants and attractions

2. **Avoid complexity**:
   - One less API to manage
   - No additional rate limits to worry about
   - Simpler error handling

3. **Focus on core features**:
   - Get Google Places working first
   - Add weather integration
   - Perfect the user experience
   - Add TripAdvisor later if needed

## 🔧 **Your Current Status**

Looking at your .env file, you have:
```bash
GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=AIzaSyBvOkBo-981BRdMRdr2zA1Q0-h1_YXo0mY  ← Needs real key
OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY=a0f6b1c2d3e4f5a6b7c8d9e0f1a2b3c4      ← Needs real key
TRIPADVISOR_API_KEY=your_tripadvisor_key_here                    ← Not needed now
```

### 🎯 **Focus on getting these 2 working first:**
1. **Google Places API** - Get real restaurant data
2. **OpenWeatherMap API** - Get real weather data

---

## 🚀 **Updated .env Configuration**

Here's what you should focus on:

```bash
# ESSENTIAL - Real restaurant data
GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=your_actual_google_places_key_here

# ESSENTIAL - Real weather data  
OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY=your_actual_openweather_key_here

# OPTIONAL - Can be left as placeholder for now
TRIPADVISOR_API_KEY=not_needed_for_now

# IMPORTANT - Keep these settings
USE_REAL_APIS=true
